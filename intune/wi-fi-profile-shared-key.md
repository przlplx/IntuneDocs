# Use a custom device profile to create a WiFi profile with a pre-shared key - Intune
[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Pre-shared keys (PSK) are typically used to authenticates users in WiFi networks, or wireless LANs. With Intune, you can create a WiFi profile using a pre-shared key. To create the profile, use the **Custom device profiles** feature within Intune. This article also includes some examples of how to create an EAP-based Wi-Fi profile.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>- Using a pre-shared key with Windows 10 causes a remediation error to appear in Intune. When this happens, the Wi-Fi profile is properly assigned to the device, and the profile works as expected.
>- If you export a Wi-Fi profile that includes a pre-shared key, be sure the file is protected. The key is in plain text, so it's your responsibility to protect the key.

## Before you begin

- It may be easier to copy the code from a computer that connects to that network, as described later in this article.
- For Android, you can also use the [Android PSK Generator](http://intunepskgenerator.johnathonb.com/).
- You can add multiple networks and keys by adding more OMA-URI settings.
- For iOS, use Apple Configurator on a Mac station to set up the profile. Or, use [iOS PSK Mobile Config Generator](http://intunepskgenerator.johnathonb.com/).
- PSK requires a string of 64 hexadecimal digits, or a passphrase of 8 to 63 printable ASCII characters. For example "*" is not supported.

## Create a custom profile
You can create a custom profile with a pre-shared key for Android, Windows, or an EAP-based Wi-Fi profile. To create the profile using the Azure portal, see [Create custom device settings](custom-settings-configure.md). When you create the device profile, choose **Custom** for your device platform. Don't select the Wi-Fi profile. When you choose custom, be sure to: 

1. Enter a name and description of the profile.
2. Add a new OMA-URI setting with the following properties: 

   a. Enter a name for this Wi-Fi network setting

   b. (Optional) Enter a description of the OMA-URI setting, or leave it blank

   c. Set the **Data Type** to **String**

   d. **OMA-URI**:

   - **For Android**: ./Vendor/MSFT/WiFi/Profile/<SSID>/Settings
   - **For Windows**: ./Vendor/MSFT/WiFi/Profile/MyNetwork/WlanXml

     > [!NOTE]
     > Be sure to include the dot character at the beginning.

     SSID is the SSID for which youâ€™re creating the policy. For example, enter `./Vendor/MSFT/WiFi/Profile/Hotspot-1/Settings`.

   e. **Value Field** is where you paste your XML code. See the examples within this article. Update each value to match your network settings. The comments section of the code includes some pointers.
3. Select **OK**, save, and then assign the policy.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This policy can only be assigned to user groups.

The next time each device checks in, the policy is applied, and a Wi-Fi profile is created on the device. The device can then connect to the network automatically.

## Android or Windows Wi-Fi profile example

The following example includes the XML code for an Android or Windows Wi-Fi profile. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `<protected>false</protected>` must be set to **false**. When **true**, it could cause the device to expect an encrypted password, and then try to decrypt it; which may result in a failed connection.
>
>  `<hex>53534944</hex>` should be set to the hexadecimal value of `<name><SSID of wifi profile></name>`.
>  Windows 10 devices may return a false *0x87D1FDE8 Remediation failed* error, but the device still contains the profile.

```

<SSID of wifi profile> = Plain text of SSID. Does not need to be escaped, could be <name>Your Company's Network</name>

## Create the XML file from an existing Wi-Fi connection
You can also create an XML file from an existing Wi-Fi connection using the following steps: 

1. On a computer that is connected to, or has recently connected to the wireless network, open the `\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces\{guid}` folder.

   Itâ€™s best to use a computer that hasn't connected to many wireless networks. Otherwise, you may have to search through each profile to find the correct one.

2. Search through the XML files to locate the file with the correct name.
3. After you have the correct XML file, copy and paste the XML code into the **Data** field of the OMA-URI settings page.

## Best practices
- Before you deploy a Wi-Fi profile with PSK, confirm that the device can connect to the endpoint directly.

- When rotating keys (passwords or passphrases), expect downtime and plan your deployments accordingly. Consider pushing new Wi-Fi profiles during non-working hours. Also, warn users that connectivity may be impacted.

- To ensure a smooth transition, make sure the end userâ€™s device has an alternate connection to the Internet. For example, the end user must be able to switch back to Guest WiFi (or some other WiFi network) or have cellular connectivity to communicate with Intune. The extra connection allows the user to receive policy updates when the corporate WiFi Profile is updated on the device.
